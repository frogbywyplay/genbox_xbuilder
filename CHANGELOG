2.1.9 -- 11/04/18
- Do not fail if jenkins is not available
- Generate depedencies in xreport

2.1.8 -- 06/03/18
- Fix analyzer plugin.
    * Add mandatory final trailing slash to root variable used to indicate
    portage which database we plan to query.

2.1.7 -- 27/01/17
- Fix runtime for analyzer plugin (#91003).
- Add analyzer plugin (#91003)
    * This plugin will, at the end of the build, parse the log of Wyplay
     components (based on LICENSE variable value in ebuild) and check if
     '-Wall' and '-Wextra' compiler flags are enabled. Then it will add its
     report to the notification mail.

2.1.6 -- 16/11/16
- Install virtual/bootstrap after target creation (#88319).
    * After target creation, we were running "xmerge world". Unfortunately,
     it may install "virtual/libc" a bit too late (often happen with vmware
     target). It is the reason why target is bootstrapped just after its
     creation so that we ensure critical components like C library are
     installed first.

2.1.5 -- 14/11/16
- Fix profile checking when warnings are fatal.
    * In a xbuilder context, when profile is checked, no profile fixer has
      already be run. Hence it will output a lot of warnings related to
      unversionned packages. So add the required code so that package.mask
      files are generated before the check and so no false warnings are
      displayed during the profile check.
- Fix gpg plugin runtime.
    * GPG plugin was broken due to the use of deprecated portage API (got
      that from a cherry pick). So fix it with the use of current portage
      API.

2.1.4 -- 12/09/16
- Look up the GPG keyring file in all directory paths which constitute current profile.
- Fix xbuilder behavior (#87457).
    * Considering profilechecker corrected behavior (it does not consider
     anymore that a missing package in packages file is an error), we have
     to adjust xbuilder behavior to become stricter. Hence a warning
     during the profile checking will abort the build.

2.1.3 -- 01/08/16
- Fix jenkinsnotifier plugin registration (#78456)
- Use xz compression instead of gzip (#82935).
    * Currently rootfs and debuginfo are compressed using gzip algorithm.
     From this point you can choose which algorithm to use to compress
     rootfs and debuginfo. By default it will use "xz" algorithm.
- Add "tar_extra_opts" option for prebuilt archive.
    * Due to some security requirements, we may want to add some extra
     options to tar command when creating the prebuilt tarball. It is the
     reason why "tar_extra_opts" option is introduced.
- Update GPG plugin to assign a file pubring.gpg per profile.

2.1.2 -- 01/03/16
- add jenkinsnotifier plugin.
    * Add a xbuilder plugin aims to notify a given Jenkins job about build
     successful finish.
2.1.1 -- 16/12/15
- Add mirror plugin.
    * Implement mirror plugin which aims to mirror prebuild on partner
     server. This plugin just requires a SSH access on partner server with a
     user allow to write files and create directories.

2.1.0 -- 09/10/15
- Integrate profile-checker into xbuilder.
    * Integrate profile-checker into xbuilder flow. xbuilder will create the
     target (using XTarget API) and then, before building it, it will check for
     profile validity and will stop if errors are found. Of course this behavior
     can be tuned through xbuilder configuration file. Just have a look at
     README.rst for configuration details.

2.0.1 -- 17/09/15
- Fix a typo mistake which was preventing the creation of prebuilts.

2.0.0 -- 17/09/15
- Fix xbuilder to be compatible with updated tools like portage >= 2.2 or xtarget >= 3.0

1.2.21 -- 11/04/18
- Do not fail if jenkins is not available

1.2.20 -- 07/12/17
- Enable parallel xz compression when using xz method
  * DEPENDS on pixz unconditionnaly
  * Relies on default compressors for all other methods

1.2.19 -- 06/12/17

- First release for binpkg xbuilder plugin (#110685).
    * Uses packages.wyplay.int server and integration user.
    * Use a list (defined in /etc/xbuilder.conf configuration file) to know
     which binary package to check.
    * Generate binary package if it does not exists.
    * Upload binary package on server after its creation.
    * If there is a problem, just log a warning and skip the problematic package
     => does not stop on problems (we do not want a build failure just because
     we failed on an optional binary package).

1.2.18 -- 09/08/17

- Update hardcatraz plugin (#104432):
    * Hardcatraz plugin was always run, even after a build failure. It's a
     waste of time so run hardcatraz plugin only on successful build.

1.2.17 -- 19/04/17

- Add support of profiles directory name 'profiles' instead of

1.2.16 -- 12/01/17

- Add analyzer plugin (#91003):
    * This plugin will, at the end of the build, parse the log of Wyplay
     components (based on LICENSE variable value in ebuild) and check if
     '-Wall' and '-Wextra' compiler flags are enabled. Then it will add its
     report to the notification mail.

1.2.15 -- 16/09/16
    
- Look up the GPG keyring file in all directory paths which constitute current profile.
    * Modification de la recherche des trousseau de clé GPG pour l'encryption de prebuilt.  Cette modification permet de parcourir l'arborescence d'un profil donnée à la recherche du 1er fichier trousseau de clé GPG rencontré.
     Cela permet d'utiliser un seul fichier GPG pour les 4 profils NCP qui utilise chacun une copie du trousseau de clé.
     Cette mutualisation permet de prevenir d'evnetulle oublie d'ajout de clé dansle trousseau de clé GPG.

1.2.14 -- 24/08/16

    
- jenkinsnotifier.py modes for either simple or parameter jobs
    * added a function to get detailed job info
    * added a mode where: if the job has parameters, push three parameters: target name, arch, and version. if not, call simple job as before.
    * fixed normal call by adding /build to the computed uri.

1.2.13 -- 10/08/16

- Add a flat_profile option in 'release' section (#83851).
    * This option aims to keep a compatibility with older xbuilder versions.
     Indeed the change related to 'profile' instead of 'arch' has some
     impacts on projects that we do not want to migrate. So add this option
     to keep a compatibility and avoid some extra changes in projects.
- Fix jenkinsnotifier plugin registration (#78456)
    * There was a mistake when registering jenkinsnotifier plugin (wrong
     class name), so fix it so that anybody is able to use jenkinsnotifier
    plugin.

1.2.12 -- 11/07/16

- Introduce 'profile' notion to replace 'arch' under given circumstances.
    * 'arch' is supposed to be related to a board. Nonetheless, these last
     years 'arch' notion has been extended to cover some new requirements in
     the project like having a default build and a hardened one. It leads to
     some arch looking more to a path rather than to an arch.
     The purpose of this development is to keep 'arch' definition as it was
     years ago and introduce the 'profile' notion to cover our new
     requirements.
- Use xz compression instead of gzip (#82935).
    * Currently rootfs and debuginfo are compressed using gzip algorithm.
     From this point you can choose which algorithm to use to compress
     rootfs and debuginfo. By default it will use "xz" algorithm.

1.2.11 -- 21/04/16

- Add "tar_extra_opts" option for prebuilt archive.
    * Due to some security requirements, we may want to add some extra
     options to tar command when creating the prebuilt tarball. It is the
     reason why "tar_extra_opts" option is introduced.

1.2.1O -- 22/03/16

- added 'from =' config to the mail section of xbuilder.conf

1.2.9 -- 01/03/16

- Fix jenkinsnotifier plugin with python2.5 (#78456).
    * jenkins notifier xbuilder plugin is based on requests python library.
     But in python2.5, requests library does not support json() method on
     Response class. So this commit implements this missing json with using
     simplejson python library.
- Implement jenkins notifier plugin.
    * Add a xbuilder plugin aims to notify a given Jenkins job about
     build successful finish.

1.2.8 -- 29/02/16

- Update GPG plugin to assign a file pubring.gpg per profile

1.2.7 -- 15/07/15

- xbuilder polka
    * mail plugin: support optional environment variables: MAIL_TO and MAIL_BODY (currently used in Polka but patched on builder every time xbuilder is emerged).
    * hardcatraz plugin: ensure environments variables are kept in subprocess

1.2.6 -- 17/06/15

- start a hardcatraz plugin. to be tested

1.2.5 -- 28/07/14

- Initial import for xbuilder 1.2.5
