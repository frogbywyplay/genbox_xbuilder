9999 -- 06/12/17

- First release for binpkg xbuilder plugin (#110685).
    * Uses packages.wyplay.int server and integration user.
    * Use a list (defined in /etc/xbuilder.conf configuration file) to know
     which binary package to check.
    * Generate binary package if it does not exists.
    * Upload binary package on server after its creation.
    * If there is a problem, just log a warning and skip the problematic package
     => does not stop on problems (we do not want a build failure just because
     we failed on an optional binary package).

1.2.18 -- 09/08/17

- Update hardcatraz plugin (#104432):
    * Hardcatraz plugin was always run, even after a build failure. It's a
     waste of time so run hardcatraz plugin only on successful build.

1.2.17 -- 19/04/17

- Add support of profiles directory name 'profiles' instead of

1.2.16 -- 12/01/17

- Add analyzer plugin (#91003):
    * This plugin will, at the end of the build, parse the log of Wyplay
     components (based on LICENSE variable value in ebuild) and check if
     '-Wall' and '-Wextra' compiler flags are enabled. Then it will add its
     report to the notification mail.

1.2.15 -- 16/09/16
    
- Look up the GPG keyring file in all directory paths which constitute current profile.
    * Modification de la recherche des trousseau de clé GPG pour l'encryption de prebuilt.  Cette modification permet de parcourir l'arborescence d'un profil donnée à la recherche du 1er fichier trousseau de clé GPG rencontré.
     Cela permet d'utiliser un seul fichier GPG pour les 4 profils NCP qui utilise chacun une copie du trousseau de clé.
     Cette mutualisation permet de prevenir d'evnetulle oublie d'ajout de clé dansle trousseau de clé GPG.

1.2.14 -- 24/08/16

    
- jenkinsnotifier.py modes for either simple or parameter jobs
    * added a function to get detailed job info
    * added a mode where: if the job has parameters, push three parameters: target name, arch, and version. if not, call simple job as before.
    * fixed normal call by adding /build to the computed uri.

1.2.13 -- 10/08/16

- Add a flat_profile option in 'release' section (#83851).
    * This option aims to keep a compatibility with older xbuilder versions.
     Indeed the change related to 'profile' instead of 'arch' has some
     impacts on projects that we do not want to migrate. So add this option
     to keep a compatibility and avoid some extra changes in projects.
- Fix jenkinsnotifier plugin registration (#78456)
    * There was a mistake when registering jenkinsnotifier plugin (wrong
     class name), so fix it so that anybody is able to use jenkinsnotifier
    plugin.

1.2.12 -- 11/07/16

- Introduce 'profile' notion to replace 'arch' under given circumstances.
    * 'arch' is supposed to be related to a board. Nonetheless, these last
     years 'arch' notion has been extended to cover some new requirements in
     the project like having a default build and a hardened one. It leads to
     some arch looking more to a path rather than to an arch.
     The purpose of this development is to keep 'arch' definition as it was
     years ago and introduce the 'profile' notion to cover our new
     requirements.
- Use xz compression instead of gzip (#82935).
    * Currently rootfs and debuginfo are compressed using gzip algorithm.
     From this point you can choose which algorithm to use to compress
     rootfs and debuginfo. By default it will use "xz" algorithm.

1.2.11 -- 21/04/16

- Add "tar_extra_opts" option for prebuilt archive.
    * Due to some security requirements, we may want to add some extra
     options to tar command when creating the prebuilt tarball. It is the
     reason why "tar_extra_opts" option is introduced.

1.2.1O -- 22/03/16

- added 'from =' config to the mail section of xbuilder.conf

1.2.9 -- 01/03/16

- Fix jenkinsnotifier plugin with python2.5 (#78456).
    * jenkins notifier xbuilder plugin is based on requests python library.
     But in python2.5, requests library does not support json() method on
     Response class. So this commit implements this missing json with using
     simplejson python library.
- Implement jenkins notifier plugin.
    * Add a xbuilder plugin aims to notify a given Jenkins job about
     build successful finish.

1.2.8 -- 29/02/16

- Update GPG plugin to assign a file pubring.gpg per profile

1.2.7 -- 15/07/15

- xbuilder polka
    * mail plugin: support optional environment variables: MAIL_TO and MAIL_BODY (currently used in Polka but patched on builder every time xbuilder is emerged).
    * hardcatraz plugin: ensure environments variables are kept in subprocess

1.2.6 -- 17/06/15

- start a hardcatraz plugin. to be tested

1.2.5 -- 28/07/14

- Initial import for xbuilder 1.2.5
